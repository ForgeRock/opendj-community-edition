How To Install OpenDJ
=====================

If you are reading this page, you have already installed the OpenDJ package.

Before You Configure

A Java SE 7 or higher runtime environment must be installed. It is recommended that your system
have at least 100MB of disk space and 256MB of free memory to run OpenDJ for evaluation purposes.
Note that you can configure OpenDJ in such a way that it requires substantially less, or more,
disk space. For more information, see the OpenDJ System Requirements at https://
