How To Install OpenDJ
=====================
Once you have downloaded and unzipped the OpenDJ directory server binaries,
you can install OpenDJ in either of two modes:

   Java-based graphical tool that enables you to install and configure
   OpenDJ directory server, load it with data and get it running quickly.
 * Interactive Command-line mode. The interactive command-line utility prompts
   you for required information before the installation and configuration begin.

 * The system must have at least 100MB of disk space and 256MB of free memory
   to run OpenDJ directory server for evaluation purposes.
